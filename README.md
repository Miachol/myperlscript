# Myperlscript
The perl script I write.

In fact, the single command of perl is more simple and useful , when you deal with the data and file ,use the single command of perl is better!!!

I like the single coommand ,you never want to scaler the "my" and other, only by 

```
perl -e '' file > result.txt   
```

you can do it fast and easy.
